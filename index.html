    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_best_friend" target"_blank"><strong>Man's best friend</strong></a> is a common phrase used to describe domestic dogs, referring to their millennia-long history of close relations, loyalty, friendship, and companionship with humans. The first recorded use of a related phrase is by Frederick the Great of Prussia. It was likely popularized by its use in a poem by Ogden Nash and has since become a common colloquialism.</p>

    <p>Before the 19th century, breeds of dogs (other than lap dogs) were largely functional. They performed activities such as hunting, tracking, watching, protecting and guarding; and language describing the dog often reflected these roles. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, "In the oldest proverbs and phrases dogs are rarely depicted as faithful or as man’s best friend, but as vicious, ravening, or watchful." Beginning in the 18th century, multiplying in the 19th and flourishing in the 20th century, language and attitudes towards dogs began to shift. Possibly, this societal shift can be attributed to discovery of the rabies vaccine in 1869.</p>

    <p>But where did the phrase “man’s best friend” come from?</p>

    <p>In fact, the phrase “man’s best friend” originated in the American Supreme Court in 1870 when a talented lawyer named George Graham Vest defended a man who deeply loved his coon hound named Old Drum. Vest argued that when a neighbor killed Old Drum for trespassing, the neighbor took the life of more than just a pet—he killed an important family member.</p>

    <p>Vest famously stated, “The one absolute, unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world—the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous—is his dog.”</p>

    <h3 style="text-decoration:underline">Here are more obvious reasons why they deserve the title.</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>They are much more than a pet because they love you unconditionally.</li>

      <li>They will motivate you to get up every day.</li>

      <li>They find the greatest joy in even the simplest of things, like you coming home from a nearby store.</li>

      <li>They keep your bed warm when it gets cold at night.</li>

      <li>They are the best listener to whatever you say, rant, complaint, or sing.</li>

      <li>They can cure your anxiety and depression because they are a great stress reliever.</li>

      <li>They fill your life with love, loyalty, fur, and many reasons to smile even if you do not like to. They are just simply the best.</li>
    </ul>
